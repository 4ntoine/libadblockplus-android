Issue 4030 - Move JNI bindings into separate library project

* created root-level 'libadblockplus-android' directory (keeping in mind upcoming tests for the library)
* moved library classes
* stripped Utils class
* moved AndroidWebRequest class to the libray too (it's the only WebRequest implementation)
+ added Maven module description
* modified README
